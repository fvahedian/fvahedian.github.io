<p>I am a Postdoctoral&nbsp;Research Fellow with the <a href="https://gemslab.github.io/">Graph Exploration and Mining at Scale (GEMS)</a> at the University of Michigan &ndash; Ann Arbor under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/">Danai Koutra</a>. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~cone/index.html">Complex Networks (CoNe) Lab</a> at the University of Notre Dame. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the DePaul University - Chicago, IL focusing on heterogenous network mining and hybrid recommendation under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/college-leadership/robin-burke">Robin Burke</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Research Interest:</strong></p>
<p>My research is focused on applied machine learning, network/graph mining and recommender systems. I am interested in investigating complex systems problems and develop multi-relational machine learning methods to solve these problems.&nbsp;</p>
