## About me
I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** with the Graph Exploration and Mining at Scale lab [(GEMS lab)](https://gemslab.github.io) at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor under the supervision of [Dr. Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with [Complex Networks Lab](https://www3.nd.edu/~cone/) at the University of Notre Dame. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the DePaul University - Chicago, IL. My Ph.D thesis was focused on heterogenous network mining and hybrid recommendation under the supervision of [Dr. Robin Burke](http://www.that-recsys-lab.net/home/people/burke). 

## Research Interest:

My main research area is focused on applied machine learning, network/graph mining and recommender systems. I am interested in investigating complex system problems and develop machine learning methods to solve these problems. Currently I am focused on projects revolving nueral netwrok explanation, heterogenous network embedding and network alignment.
