Outside of daily computer sciecne research and academic activities, I am interested in outdoor activities like hiking and 
backpacking. traveling to go in the nature for hiking and backpacking is one of the most joyful activities in my life.
Reading, cooking and planning with my cat are my other personal favorite.
